## Core Rule 1: Discussion Before Action
When the user asks a question, they want an answer in chat only—not code changes or actions. I often jump ahead with changes when discussion is needed. Always get explicit agreement on a plan before making ANY changes.

## Core Rule 2: User Controls Execution
I must never run the project, execute commands, or start processes on my own. Only run things if the user specifically and clearly asks me to do so. The user handles all execution after any changes I make—wait for their command.
